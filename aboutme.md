I am currently a final year master's student in Data Science at RWTH Aachen University.
I am also a student research assistant at the [Chair for Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Homepage/index.html), where I work on knowledge-grounded dialog systems.
